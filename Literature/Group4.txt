Team 8: Attention is all you need

finds a way to increase inputs for sections you care about and reduce the ones you dont and then label the image 

1.) apply a "filter"/"mask" that might identify floor or cat or dog or person.

	- these "filters" are "learned".

2.) then feed these filters though a network to classify.
	
	- the more of these layers you give the more "context" is given than the better this preforms

this can be done for:
	language translation
	image classification
	and any other task you give it
