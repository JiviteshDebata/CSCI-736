Why gate units? To avoid input weight con
icts, inj controls the error 
ow to memory cell
cj 's input connections wcj i . To circumvent cj 's output weight con
icts, outj controls the error

ow from unit j's output connections. In other words, the net can use inj to decide when to keep
or override information in memory cell cj , and outj to decide when to access memory cell cj and
when to prevent other units from being perturbed by cj (see Figure 1).
Error signals trapped within a memory cell's CEC cannot change { but dierent error signals

owing into the cell (at dierent times) via its output gate may get superimposed. The output
gate will have to learn which errors to trap in its CEC, by appropriately scaling them. The
