Hard stuck on math.

The matrix aproach is [z][I1] == [z][I2].
This approach is stuck because of the non-linearity of [z].

[z] = H([x][w]+[b]) where H(x) in invertable but not linear.
Generaly: IF H(x) is nonlinear, than H^-1(x)H(x)G(x) != G(x) even if G(x) is linear.

Given that [I1] = [1 0 0] and [I2] = [0 0 0] it is currently unclear if [I1] and [I2] are general cases or special cases where H^-1(x)H(x)G(x) == G(x)
                  [0 0 0]            [0 1 0]
                  [0 0 0]            [0 0 0]


The ALGRIBREIC aprach is stuck since it is not clear how to deal with e^(ax) + e^(by) = C

While e^(ax) + e^(by) = C does have solutions most of the time, I can not find how to go about solving this for x or y.


While the current focus is on 2 variables, (x1, x2) the solution to this equasion needs to be adaptable to (x1, x2, x3,... ,xn). 

The solution does not need to be efficient, only better than x^n where x is all possible input values of x and n is all input nodes.
